 Music Player Readme

This C# console application, named "MusicPlayer," allows users to play music by providing the file path of the desired music file. Below is a detailed explanation of the provided code.

 Project Structure

- **Music.cs:** This is the main class containing the `Main` method. It serves as the entry point for the application and demonstrates the usage of the `PlayMusic` method.

- SoundPlayer: This is an internal class within the `Music` class. It encapsulates the functionality related to playing music, providing a modular structure to the code.

 Main Method

The `Main` method in the `Music` class is the starting point of the application. It calls the `PlayMusic` method with a sample file path ("chiling39-20915") and outputs "Playing music" to the console. The `Console.ReadLine()` is used to keep the console application running until the user presses Enter.

 PlayMusic Method

The `PlayMusic` method is a public method that takes a file path as a parameter and plays the specified music using a `SoundPlayer` instance. The file path is set to the `SoundLocation` property of the `SoundPlayer` class, and the `Play` method is called to initiate music playback.

 SoundPlayer Class

The `SoundPlayer` class is an internal class within the `Music` class, encapsulating the music playing functionality. It has a `SoundLocation` property to store the file path and an internal `Play` method. However, the `Play` method currently throws a `NotImplementedException` and needs to be implemented to facilitate actual music playback.

 How to Use

1. Clone or download the MusicPlayer project.
2. Open the project in a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the application.
4. The program will play the specified music file ("chiling39-20915") and display "Playing music" in the console.
5. Press Enter to exit the application.

 Dependencies

The code relies on the `System.Media` namespace for handling music playback. Ensure that the necessary libraries are referenced in your project.

Note
The `SoundPlayer` class's `Play` method needs to be implemented with appropriate logic to play the music. The current placeholder (`NotImplementedException`) should be replaced with the actual code for playing music.
